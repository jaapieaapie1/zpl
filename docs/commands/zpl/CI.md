# ^CI




ZPL Commands


The `^CI` command enables you to call up the international character set you want to use for printing. You
can mix character sets on a label.


**Change International Font/Encoding**


Zebra printers can print fonts using international character sets: U.S.A.1, U.S.A.2, UK, Holland, Denmark/
Norway, Sweden/Finland, Germany, France 1, France 2, Italy, Spain, and several other sets, including the
Unicode character set.


A character within a font can be remapped to a different numerical position.


In x.14 version of firmware and later, this command allows character remapping when the parameter `a =`
0-13.

**Format:** `^CIa,s1,d1,s2,d2,...`

1. The encoding is controlled by the conversion table ( `*.DAT` ). The correct table must be present for the
conversion to function. The table generated by ZTools™ is the TrueType font's internal encoding (Unicode).

2. Shift-JIS encoding converts Shift-JIS to JIS and then looks up the JIS conversion in `JIS.DAT` . This table
must be present for Shift-JIS to function.

3. The `^CI17` command has been deprecated, along with the `^F8` and `^F16` commands that are required
for the `^CI17` command to function. The recommended replacement is the `^CI28` - `30` commands.

4. Supports ASCII transparency for Asian encodings. 7F and less are treated as single-byte characters. 80
to FE is treated as the first byte of a 2-byte character 8000 to FEFF in the encoding table for Unicode.

ZPL Commands


80 to FF could mean a quad byte in GB18030. The `^CI26` command can also be used to support the
GB 18030 and Big5 HKSCS encodings. The GB 18030 uses the `GB18030.DAT` encoding table and BIG5
HKSCS uses the `BIG5HK.DAT` encoding table.


The `^CI17` command has been deprecated, along with the `^F8` and `^F16` commands that are required
for the `^CI17` command to function. The recommended replacement is the `^CI28-30` commands.


We recommend that a `^CI` command (or Unicode BOM) is included at the beginning of each ZPL script.
This is important when ZPL scripts with different encodings are being sent to a single printer. To assist in
the interleaving of encoding schemes, the printer maintains two encoding states ( `^CI0` - `28` and `^CI29`

- `30` ). It automatically acknowledges when it should switch encoding states, allowing it to distinguish
between encodings, and maintains a `^CI` for each, but endianness is shared.

**Example:** This example remaps the Euro symbol (21) decimal to the dollar sign value (36) decimal. When
the dollar sign character is sent to the printer, the Euro symbol prints:


The font selected determines the shape and resolution of the printed symbol.

**Comments:** The space character cannot be remapped for any font.
