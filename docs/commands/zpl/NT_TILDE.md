# ~NT




ZPL Network Commands


The `~NT` command sets the currently connected network printer to be transparent.


**Set Currently Connected Printer Transparent**

**Format:** `~NT`

**Comments:** With Z Series printers, the `~NT` command functions the same as the `~NR` command. All
Z Series printers on a network receive the transmission.

The commands `~NC`, `^NI`, `~NR`, and `~NT` are used only with RS-485 printer communications.
