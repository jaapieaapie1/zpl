# ^KN




ZPL Commands


The printer’s network name and description can be set using the `^KN` command. `^KN` is designed to
make your Zebra printer easy for users to identify. The name the administrator designates is listed on the
configuration label and on the Web page generated by the printer.


**Define Printer Name**

**Format:** `^KNa,b`


**NOTE:** If you issue the command `^KN,` (without the a and b parameters) you are setting the
printer name and description to a blank string.

To cause the printer name and printer description settings controlled by the `^KN` command to be saved,
you must issue the `^JUS` command.
