# Control and Flow



This section outlines the commands to conditionally execute code and control the flow of the program.
Here is a quick list of these commands:


**IF Statements**
Executes or skips a sequence of statements, depending on the value of a Boolean expression.

**DO Loops**
Repeats instructions based on the results of a comparison.

**FOR Loops**
A control flow statement which allows code to be executed iteratively.

**GOTO/GOSUB**
Causes an unconditional jump or transfer of control from one point in a program to another.

**SUB**
Allows you to "substitute" names instead of actual line numbers as the target of `GOSUB` s and
`GOTO` s.

**EXIT**
Used to exit the `DO` and `FOR` loops.

**END**
Terminates any program currently running.
