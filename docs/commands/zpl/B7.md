# ^B7




ZPL Commands


The `^B7` command produces the PDF417 barcode, a two-dimensional, multirow, continuous, stacked
symbology. PDF417 is capable of encoding over 1,000 characters per barcode. It is ideally suited for
applications requiring large amounts of information at the time the barcode is read.


**PDF417 Bar Code**


The barcode consists of three to 90 stacked rows. Each row consists of start and stop patterns and symbol
characters called **code-words** . A code word consists of four bars and four spaces. A three-code-word
minimum is required per row.

The PDF417 barcode is also capable of using the structured append option ( `^FM` ), which allows you to
extend the field data limitations by printing multiple barcodes. For more information on using structured
append, see ^FM.


- PDF417 has a fixed print ratio.

- Field data ( `^FD)` is limited to 3K of character data.

**Format:** `^B7o,h,s,c,r,t`











|Parameters|Details|
|---|---|
|`o =` orientation|**Values:**<br>`N =` normal`R =` rotated 90 degrees (clockwise)<br>`I =` inverted 180 degrees<br>`B =` read from the bottom up, 270 degrees<br>**Default:** current`^FW` value|
|`h =` bar code height<br>for individual rows (in<br>dots)|**Values:** `1` to height of label<br>**Default:** value set by`^BY`<br>This number multiplied by the module equals the height of the individual rows<br>in dots. If this number is not specified, the overall barcode height, divided by<br>the number of rows, equals the height of the individual rows in dots, where the<br>overall barcode height is defined by the`^BY` command. 1 is not a recommended<br>value.|
|`s =` security level|**Values:** `1` to`8` (error detection and correction)<br>**Default:** `0` (error detection only)<br>This determines the number of error detection and correction code words to<br>be generated for the symbol. The default level provides only error detection<br>without correction. Increasing the security level adds increasing levels of error<br>correction and increases the symbol size.|
|`c =` number of data<br>columns to encode|**Values:** `1` to`30`<br>**Default:** `1:2` (row-to-column aspect ratio)<br>You can specify the number of code-word columns giving control over the width<br>of the symbol.|

ZPL Commands



|Parameters|Details|
|---|---|
|`r =` number of rows<br>to encode|**Values:** `3` to`90`<br>**Default:** `1:2` (row-to-column aspect ratio)<br>You can specify the number of symbol rows giving control over the height of<br>the symbol. For example, with no row or column values entered, 72 code words<br>would be encoded into a symbol of six columns and 12 rows. Depending on<br>code words, the aspect ratio is not always exact.|
|`t =` truncate right<br>row indicators and<br>stop pattern|**Values:**<br>`N =` no truncation<br>`Y =` perform truncation<br>**Default:** `N`|


**Examples**

ZPL Commands


This example shows the `^B7` command used with field hex ( `^FH` ) characters:


**Comments:** Noted in this bulleted list:


- If both columns and rows are specified, their product must be less than 928.


- No symbol is printed if the product of columns and rows is greater than 928.


- No symbol is printed if total code words are greater than the product of columns and rows.

ZPL Commands


- Serialization is not allowed with this barcode.


- The truncation feature can be used in situations where label damage is not likely. The right row
indicators and stop pattern are reduced to a single module bar width. The difference between a nontruncated and a truncated barcode is shown in the previous examples.


**Special Considerations for ^BY When Using PDF417**

When used with `^B7`, the parameters for the `^BY` command are:

`w =` **module width (in dots)**

**Values:** `2` to `10`

**Default:** `2`

`r =` **ratio**

**Fixed Value:** `3` (ratio has no effect on PDF417)

**h** `=` **height of bars (in dots)**

**Values:** `1` to `32000`

**Default:** `10`

PDF417 uses this only when row height is not specified in the `^B7` `h` parameter.


**Special Considerations for ^FD When Using PDF417**

The character set sent to the printer with the `^FD` command includes the full ASCII set, except for those
characters with special meaning to the printer.


See Zebra Code Page 850 — Latin Character Set on page 1548, ^CC ~CC on page 152, and ^CT ~CT on
page 166.

- CR and LF are also valid characters for all `^FD` statements. This scheme is used:

`\& =` carriage return/line feed

`\\ =` backslash (\)

- `^CI13` must be selected to print a backslash (\).
