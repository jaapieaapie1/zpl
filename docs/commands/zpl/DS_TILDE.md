of the font in bytes.

The `~DS` command, and its associated parameters, is the result of converting a vendor-supplied font for
use on a Zebra printer. To convert this font use the ZTools utility.

**Format:** `~DSd:o.x,s,data`






|Parameters|Details|
|---|---|
|`d =` device to store image|**Values:** `R:`, `E:`, `B:`, and`A:`<br>**Default:** `R:`|
|`o =` image name|**Values:** `1` to`8` alphanumeric characters<br>**Default:** if a name is not specified, UNKNOWN is used|
|`x =` extension|**Fixed Value:** `.FNT`|
|`s =` size of font in bytes|**Fixed Value:** this number is generated by ZTools and should not be<br>changed|
|`data =` ASCII<br>hexadecimal string that<br>defines font|**Fixed Value:** this number is generated by ZTools and should not be<br>changed|



**Example:** This example shows the first three lines of a scalable font that was converted using the ZTools
program and is ready to be downloaded to the printer. If necessary, the destination and object name can
be changed.

**Comments:** Downloaded scalable fonts are not checked for integrity. If they are corrupt, they cause
unpredictable results at the printer.


If you are using a TrueType font use these commands: `~DT`, `~DU`, and `~DY` . To determine when to use the
noted commands, see ~DT on page 179, ~DU on page 180, and ~DY on page 181.
